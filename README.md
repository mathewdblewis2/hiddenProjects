this is a git repo for storing encrypted zips of projects I'd like to share
with non github users


FUTURE PLANS:
have 2 repos, a public one and private one
have the private one contain the development of the project and its history
have an action that pushes the private one to the public one, doing the zipping and so on
also have another action that sends an email to a stored email address associated with
the recipient of the project
